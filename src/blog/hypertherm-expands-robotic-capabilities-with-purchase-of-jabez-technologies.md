**HANOVER, N.H.—July 30, 2015—** Jabez Technologies, creators of software to simplify complex robotic programming, is joining Hypertherm, a U.S. based manufacturer of plasma, waterjet, and laser cutting systems, to make it easier for companies to utilize robots for manufacturing applications.

Simple offline programming is a key barrier to the wider utilization of robots in manufacturing. Hypertherm and Jabez believe combining Hypertherm’s cutting expertise with Jabez’s skilled engineering and support staff will make it easier for robotic programmers and integrators to achieve optimal results. At the same time, Jabez can enhance its support for a wide variety of robotic programming applications, including those beyond cutting, by leveraging Hypertherm’s global infrastructure and strong engineering community.

“A growing trend toward lean and flexible manufacturing is resulting in the expanded use of robotics in our served industries. Manufacturers realize that robots are increasingly critical to producing higher quality products at a lower cost, and to achieving the speed and flexibility needed to remain competitive,” Evan Smith, Hypertherm’s President and CEO commented. “Adding Jabez to the Hypertherm team will enable Hypertherm to bring even greater value to our robotic customers, and at the same time provide Jabez with the support and resources to achieve its wider vision, which we share.” 

Hypertherm is not making any major changes to Jabez’s operations, leadership structure, or distribution channels. Chahe Bakmazjian, founder and president of the privately held company, will continue to lead his team as part of Hypertherm’s newly established Robotic Software group. Jabez’s current offices in the Montreal area will remain intact, with no consolidations or reductions planned. Support for non-Hypertherm cutting systems, non-cutting applications and previously planned investments in engineering and support resources will continue. In addition, Jabez Associates will receive all Hypertherm benefits, including profit sharing and full participation in the company’s employee stock value plan. The transaction was structured as a purchase of substantially all assets of Jabez Technologies. Financial terms are undisclosed.

“We are excited to join the Hypertherm family. Hypertherm’s vision regarding the future of industrial robotics as well as the cultural alignment between our companies made a perfect and natural fit,” explains Chahe Bakmazjian. “Additionally, we can leverage Hypertherm’s global service, support and logistics resources to better serve our rapidly growing base of robotic integrators and end users to accelerate the growth of Robotmaster.”

Jabez Technologies specializes in simplifying complex robotic programming for 3D shapes, particularly in high-mix manufacturing environments. With the ability to program many different robots across multiple processes, and by providing tools for easy cell setup and configuration, its Robotmaster software delivers the flexibility required to support a wide variety of robotic applications. Built-in simulation tools, on-the-fly calculation capabilities and unique optimization and collision avoidance tools allow programmers to quickly prepare their jobs with confidence.

Hypertherm designs and manufactures advanced cutting products for use in a variety of industries such as shipbuilding, manufacturing, and automotive repair. Its product line includes plasma, laser and waterjet cutting systems, in addition to CNC motion and height controls, CAM nesting software, robotic software and consumables. Hypertherm systems are trusted for performance and reliability that result in increased productivity and profitability for hundreds of thousands of businesses. The New Hampshire based company’s reputation for cutting innovation dates back nearly 50 years to 1968, with Hypertherm’s invention of water injection plasma cutting. The 100 percent associate owned company, consistently named a best place to work, has more than 1,400 associates along with operations and partner representation worldwide.
