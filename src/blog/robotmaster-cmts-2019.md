Manufacturers and job shops with high-mix, low-volume production often struggle to justify the time and expertise required to program robotic cells. Mass customization, shorter production runs and smaller lot sizes challenge traditional automation methods. Manufacturing is changing and technology must keep pace. Today, the implementation of automated manufacturing processes must be as dynamic as the market and robot programming must be equally agile.

Until now, harnessing the boundless flexibility of robots was the exclusive domain of large companies with deep pockets. Robotmaster changes all that. With over 16 years of research & development and their strong background in CAD/CAM software, Hypertherm's Robotic Software team has been able to bring a revolutionary approach to programming industrial robots. Today, Robotmaster software is running on robots drilling airplane fuselages, polishing automotive dies, and adding value to a multitude of processes at family-owned job shops around the world. 

Visit us at CMTS to know how you can take full advantage of your robot cell and increase your profitability with your high-mix, low-volume production runs.
