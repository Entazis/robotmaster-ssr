Jabez Technologies will be exhibiting at Automate 2015 at McCormick Place in Chicago, IL from March 23rd – 26th! Come and meet with us at Booth #270 to hear more about our robot programming technologies!

Discover the industry’s leading work-flow driven software that has enabled the economic implementation of robots to companies of all sizes, from small businesses to large international manufacturers. If you’re attending Automate 2015, we invite you to stop by our booth and experience Robotmaster Version 6.2 which is now available and at least 3 and up to 10 times faster than the previous version.   

Robotmaster allows manufacturing companies the ability to use robots for high-mix low-batch part production. In addition, Robotmaster easily and cost effectively programs robots for many typical manufacturing processes. One of its greatest strengths is that it minimizes downtime and prevents costly errors and collisions. 

Come and meet our international team of Robotmaster partners from North America.
