**HANOVER, N.H.—Nov. 25, 2015** — Hypertherm’s Robotic Software Team is fielding a record number of inquiries for its Robotmaster offline programing software following this month’s FABTECH trade show in Chicago. 

The team is celebrating the introduction of a new suite of specialized tools that make it easy to optimize robotic welding and cutting—whether plasma, laser, or waterjet—by creating optimized paths. Additionally, these tools include one-click automatic programming that results in error-free robotic programs for both simple and very complex cuts and welds.

Team leader Chahe Bakmazjian says a significant rise in robotic cutting and welding in recent years is prompting greater adoption of robotic technology. “A sharp increase in demand for small-batch and high-mix applications is causing more companies to turn to robots,” explains Bakmazjian. “Robots are ideal for these sorts of jobs because they have the ability to adapt to frequent changes; however, simple programming is key since the traditional method of teaching a robot is very time consuming.”

Hypertherm’s Robotmaster software makes it possible to program almost any type of robot offline using familiar CAD/CAM software. For example, live demonstrations at FABTECH showcased a Fanuc robot operating a welding gun and an ABB robot with a plasma cutting torch. A total of five booths had their robots programmed with Robotmaster and running live demos for passerby’s at FABTECH 2015.

People interested in learning more about Robotmaster and hearing from a manufacturer currently using the software can do so by watching a new video that shows how one company is remaining competitive and expanding its use of robots despite having little to no robotic programming experience.
