### The Goal: Profitability
The emergence and expansion of robots in the industrial manufacturing space are due in large measure to the wide variety of exceptional benefits they deliver. Robots ensure standardized processes and dependable quality output, and the more that they drive operational efficiencies the greater their impact on cost reduction. This of course is the ultimate goal; for manufacturers to use their robots as a means to achieve a competitive edge, and ultimately to increase profitability. 

### The Challenge: Robot Programming
Shop owners continue to struggle to generate the expected increases in throughput and productivity to significantly impact their bottom line. A key reason for this is the complexity they experience in programming their robot for the production run. In fact, robot programming has been an unexpected -and sometimes frustrating- bottleneck for many shop owners.

Why has it been so challenging to program a robot for industrial manufacturing applications? For starters, there’s the mere fact that the variety of customized parts being presented to industrial manufacturers for fabrication can be characterized by having an infinite number of potential geometries, contours and paths. Robot programs must accommodate for every type. While robots can be programmed to tackle these different idiosyncrasies, there are a wide number of problems that can ensue. These include hard to anticipate events such as the collision between the robot and the part during a transition from one operation to another. 

To compound this, when the user would encounter a specific problem at a given point during the run, the solution chosen (from many possibilities!) would often negatively affect the remaining robot trajectory in its course to complete the task (welding, cutting, etc.). Often, the solution to that one problem would lead to many other problems due to the robot’s modified orientation. In general, the industry had not figured out how to cope with this reality. 

### Enter the Robotmaster Value Proposition
Robotmaster, the leading brand of software programs for industrial robots, already offered specialized programming solutions that facilitate the programming task. After all, Robotmaster has been 100% focused on robots since 2001. The team behind the brand knew that delivering an enhanced global view of the entire robotic operation was critical, but that developing a newly created architecture could offer the most advanced tools in the industry. Mere enhancement was not the goal. The prevalent simulation software offered by many suppliers is reasonably good at demonstrating the existence of one problem at a time, but Robotmaster knew it had to do better. To support the end-users in their quest for operational efficiency, Robotmaster understood that showing a problem is not nearly as helpful as solving a problem! They would focus not on simulation to merely show a problem, but on advance path planning and optimization. Of course, -easier said than done!

### Complexity and Simplicity
The two terms -complexity and simplicity -are typically viewed as representing opposite extremes. Advanced technology itself is of course complex, and few associated undertakings are more challenging than the development of robotic programming software for sophisticated industrial manufacturing applications. The software development and application engineers at Robotmaster recognized some important distinctions. While the technology and development processes are exceedingly complex, the usability of software should be anything but! They knew that they had to leverage the inherent complexity…to deliver superbly elegant simplicity. The software would necessarily be loaded with complex features but had to be offered so that even the application-expert with no previous CAD/CAM or robot programming experience could quickly and effectively learn to use the software with confidence. 

### Seeing Things Differently
So, the Robotmaster team’s challenge to build a new robot programming platform for the user -and around the user- began by looking at things in a different way. Envisioning how to harness complex technology to deliver effective tools that were simple to use and could help solve problems was generally viewed as impractical. The prevailing notion? Programming robots is undeniably complicated, and that’s just how it is. After all, Teach Pendant programming has been around for over 25 years, with the “biggest” change being the enhancement to offline versions. Robotmaster had already garnered widespread industry recognition as offering the most advanced tools, but the question in technology is always how to improve to deliver breakthrough advances.

So of course, Robotmaster decided to undauntingly assemble the best team of multifunctional experts to develop a new innovative architecture from scratch that would be exceeding simple to use. This new platform was given the most unassuming of names: Robotmaster V7.

### Keeping it Simple Meant Having a New Plan
Developing a new architecture from the ground up (of course, building upon years of development experience) meant that the blueprint had to be planned. The objectives had to be clear and the road map had to be defined. With all the technical expertise, the complex functionality had to be delivered with tools that were simple and intuitive to use. This is where Robotmaster has turned complexity into simplicity. The “background coding” was not for the faint of heart, and the years of work that went into delivering such simple and effective tools could not be easily imagined. 

### Power Combined with Simplicity as Never Seen Before
Advantage goes to the user! The most powerful tools are also the simplest to use.
<ul>
  <li>Correcting an entire robot program with the click of a mouse to ensure a collision free, error free run.</li>
  <li>Presenting a representation of the robot path to visualize all potential problems to solve them all at once… before they occur.</li>
  <li>Providing instant path optimization for the smoothest and most logical robot run. Having a tool which graphically optimizes robot trajectories between operations, so the user can avoid collisions by simply selecting an alternative transition.</li>
  <li>Having a tool which graphically optimizes robot trajectories between operations, so the user can avoid collisions by simply selecting an alternative transition.</li>
  <li>Having a graphic representation of workspace boundaries where the user can simply click & drag an out-of-reach part back into an acceptable parameter, and the robot becomes instantly reprogrammed. </li>
</ul>
These are but a few of the powerful innovations that Robotmaster developed and improved upon, justifiably expressed as revolutionary!

### Power + Simplicity = Profitability
When development is done with the end user in mind, it is clear that the product offered must support the ultimate customer objective of increasing revenues and optimizing profits. This is exactly what Robotmaster has accomplished. Powerful and simple to use tools means faster training for users, quicker set up, speedier robot programming, and error free results. Time savings equate to the ability to accept more jobs and different types of applications because the various tools are all available, powerful, and stunningly easy to use!
