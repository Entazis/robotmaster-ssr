**MONTREAL, July  7, 2016** – Hypertherm Inc., developer of Robotmaster programming software, together with its Brazilian distributor, RobotM-Br, is collaborating with the Instituto Avançado de Robótica (I.A.R.) in a pioneering initiative to take robotics training on the road in Brazil. 

Exclusively dedicated to industrial robotics, I.A.R.’s Advanced Mobile Unit is a dynamic, high-tech training environment on wheels. This 50-foot-long, air conditioned semitrailer is outfitted with two classroom-style training areas, multimedia presentation and conferencing capabilities, and six-axis robots for hands-on experience with the latest technologies.

Robotmaster software will be used as the reference for developing a new introductory training course in best practices for offline programming. Robotmaster seamlessly integrates offline programming, simulation and optimization to any CAD/CAM platform for quick, error-free robot programs with one integrated software solution.

“We are honored that I.A.R. selected Robotmaster as the reference for its new training and we’re pleased to collaborate with them on this novel mobile training center,” said Chahe Bakmazjian, Business Team Leader for Hypertherm Robotic Software. “We share I.A.R’s passion for bringing innovative robotics technology to Brazil’s next generation of engineers and technicians.”

The Advanced Mobile Unit will travel throughout Brazil, parking for days and even weeks at universities, trade shows and corporations. I.A.R.’s partners and customers seeking advanced training in mechatronics and industrial robotics can schedule a visit, and have curriculum and onboard technology customized to their needs. 

Robotmaster software was there when the big rig rolled into the university campuses of UNIMEP and SATC in southern Brazil this past June. I.A.R.’s mobile unit also made an appearance at Metal Mineração, the mining and metalworking industry fair ( <a href="http://www.metalmineracao.com.br" target="_blank">metalmineracao.com.br</a> )  .
