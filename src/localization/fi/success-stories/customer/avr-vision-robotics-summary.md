<br />Application: *Deburring*
<br />Industry: *Aircraft Engines*

The de-burring of combustion chambers for aircraft engines is about as complex a machining job as it gets, requiring tracing detailed trajectories over more than 600 features, using 3 or 4 different tools on each. AV&R has developed a broad range of expertise in enabling robots to perform complex tasks such as this, achieving high repeatability, increased speed and enhanced precision. But manually programming the robot is a painstaking job. Aerospace manufacturers are under extreme pressure to reduce new product introduction times.
