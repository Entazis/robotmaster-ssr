Weber Aircraft is one of the leading manufacturers of commercial aircraft seats for airlines and major aircraft manufacturers worldwide. In recent years, they have faced tremendous downward pressure on price while being determined to maintain their excellent and hard-earned reputation for product quality and customer satisfaction. A robotic-based routing cell was the right technical and economic answer to meet these objectives, but integrating the robot workcell into their existing manufacturing engineering process was a problem. Weber needed to be able to program their robot with the same ease, flexibility and efficiency as they programmed their CNC machines.
