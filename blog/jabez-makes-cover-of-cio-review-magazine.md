Jabez Technologies (developers of Robotmaster) makes the cover of CIO Review Magazine and gets recognized as one of the 10 Most Promising Engineering Solution Providers for 2014. Jabez Technologies was selected for successful implementation of CAD/CAM software for elevating the performance of the robotics industry allowing manufacturers to seamlessly interact with robots through a new intuitive programming interface.  What differentiates Robotmaster from classic off-line programming is that robot paths are calculated automatically and no point-by-point intervention is required. Robot errors and limitations are identified and fixed automatically. Tasks that would require meticulous and skilled intervention can now be successfully programmed in minutes by a newbie to robotics using Robotmaster

## CIO Review’s Selection Criteria
Over the past 3 months, CIO Review looked at hundreds of solution providers that are at the forefront of tackling engineering design and manufacturing challenges with cutting-edge strategies and solutions.
CIO Review evaluated a vendor’s capability to fulfill the needs of the engineering design and manufacturing sector through offering state-of-the-art CAD/CAM solutions that enable engineers to deliver projects which are stronger, better and more efficient.

## Robotmaster: Simplifying Robotics Like Never Before
Jabez Technologies has helped many companies, including those who were looking to adopt robots for part production, using various processes like trimming, laser or water-jet cutting, drilling, milling, riveting and welding to name a few. Robotmaster has facilitated robotization to companies of all sizes, from small local shops to large organizations like Daimler, Boeing and General Electric.
With the continued move towards high-mix low-batch type manufacturing, where the emphasis is more towards mass customization than mass automation, industries are expected to support and enhance the use of robots in their operations. Towards this, Jabez Technologies continues to build intuitive and easy-to-use robot programming softwares that are suitable for customers who have little or no expertise in robotics.
