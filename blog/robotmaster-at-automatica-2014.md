Robotmaster will be exhibiting at AUTOMATICA, the International Trade Fair for Automation and Mechatronics that runs from June 3 to 6 2014 in Munich (Germany).  Come visit us at Hall B4, Stand 307 and ask for a demo of Robotmaster.  Discover the revolutionary software that has enabled the economic implementation of robots to companies of all sizes, from small local shops to large global manufacturing conglomerates.  New Robotmaster features will be unveiled that continue to break the programing cost/complexity barrier.

Robotmaster allows manufacturing companies the ability to use robots for high-mix low-batch part production.  Robotmaster easily and cost effectively automates robots for many typical manufacturing processes.  These processes include simple & complex welding, trimming, laser/plasma/water-jet cutting, de-burring, de-flashing, polishing, grinding, milling, drilling and riveting.  Tasks that would once require meticulous and skilled intervention can now be successfully programmed in minutes by a newbie to robotics.

A live milling demo of a model of the new Kuka lightweight LBR iiwa robot will be demonstrated using a KUKA KR60 HA robot and dual-axis positioner. In addition, you will be able to see Robotmaster in action at other partner booths!

Come meet our international team of Robotmaster partners from: Europe, North America, China, South Asia and Brazil.
