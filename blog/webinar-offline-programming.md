**Montreal, CANADA, September 27, 2019** – The <a href="https://www.robotics.org/">Robotic Industry Association</a> (RIA) will be hosting a <a href="http://bit.ly/2nQcS1b">webinar</a> on robotic offline programming on Tuesday, October 1, 2019 from 12pm - 1pm EST. The webinar will be hosted by two of the Senior Software Sales Managers of leading CAD/CAM-based offline robotic programming software, Robotmaster. 

With manufacturers and job shops with high-mix, low-volume production often struggling to justify the time and expertise required to program robotic cells, mass customization, shorter production runs and smaller lot sizes challenge traditional automation methods. Manufacturing is changing and technology must keep pace. Today, the implementation of automated manufacturing processes must be as dynamic as the market and robot programming must be equally agile.

Offline programming is revolutionizing how robots are programmed, allowing integrators to expand their product offerings into new markets and enabling manufacturers to automate what once was a manual process. Different than simulation software, a complete robot programming solution allows companies to create programs faster, easier and collision-free while keeping their robots running.

Attendees of this webinar will understand the differences between Emulators, Simulation Software, and Off-Line Programming Software (OLP). Additionally, attendees will learn the benefits of integrated robotic path creation and how this could help increase robotic programming capabilities.
