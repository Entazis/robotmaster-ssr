Robots are often underestimated in manufacturing circles as being inaccurate and dismissed as only suitable for welding or pick and place applications. With better accuracy machine designs and improved calibration methods now allowing robots to provide tolerances of 0.1mm/0.005in or less, robots are no longer uncommon in machining type applications. In addition, off-line programming (OLP) suites offer features that can take advantage of better robot tolerances and produce robot trajectories from CAD/CAM data. \"Being able to create toolpaths directly from our designer's solid CAD models has significantly improved the accuracy of our carbon fiber components.\"
