General Atomics had acquired an impressive waterjet robotic work cell - an ideal solution for trimming the 30-foot carbon/epoxy composite wing assemblies of their unmanned aircraft system (UAS). When it came time to upload cutting patterns from their CAD files however, they came to the disconcerting realisation that developing tool trajectories for a 7-axis robot work cell directly from CAD was uncharted territory. The significant investment made in their robot equipment, as well as their capability to satisfy their production commitments, was at risk.
