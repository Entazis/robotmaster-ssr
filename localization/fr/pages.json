	"about-story-1": "Robotmaster aide les entreprises à améliorer leur productivité en leur permettant de programmer facilement et efficacement leurs robots. Notre logiciel, leader en programmation hors-ligne, offre de nombreux outils simples et rapides, permettant de programmer les robots pour de multiples applications, économisant ainsi temps et argent et maximisant le retour sur investissement.",
	"about-story-2": "L’idée est née en 2001, nous n’étions pas d’accord avec la croyance qui dominait l’industrie à l’époque et qui stipulait que l’apprentissage était la meilleure façon de programmer les robots industriels.  Nous avons donc décidé de montrer que la programmation hors-ligne, basée sur un logiciel de CFAO, était la solution vers plus de productivité et de qualité.",
	"about-story-3": "C’est en 2002 que nous avons dévoilé la première version du logiciel de CFAO robotique : Robotmaster. Une réponse exceptionnellement positive des fabricants et des intégrateurs de robots nous confirmait que nous étions bien sur la bonne voie. Cela nous a amené à combiner notre expertise en technologies de développement CFAO avec des mathématiques appliquées et cinématiques de robots pour ainsi parfaire et étendre les fonctionnalités présentes dans Robotmaster.",
	"about-story-4": "Les années suivantes, nous avons continué à améliorer le logiciel, lui permettant ainsi de supporter un grand nombre de robots industriels pour de multiples industries. Aujourd’hui, les robots programmés grâce à Robotmaster sont performants dans des applications aussi variées que le détourage, la découpe,  l’usinage,  l’ébavurage,  la soudure, le polissage, le sablage, la peinture et plus encore… Les qualités de Robotmaster ne sont d’ailleurs pas passées inaperçues, récoltant louanges et compliments auprès de ses clients mais aussi de différents médias.",
	"about-story-5": "Ainsi, la capacité du logiciel à rendre la programmation des robots industriels facile, rapide et efficace lui a valu le prix « Game Changer For Motion Control » à la conférence RoboBusiness de 2013. En 2015, le magazine CIO Review nous a nommés dans sa liste des 20 fournisseurs de solutions robotiques les plus prometteurs.",
	"about-story-6": "Dorénavant membre de la famille Hypertherm et opérant en tant que « Hypertherm Robotic Software Inc. », nous avons le privilège de pouvoir bénéficier de l’infrastructure mondiale d’Hypertherm pour satisfaire rapidement à l'évolution des besoins et des défis de l'industrie, facilitant ainsi la tâche des programmeurs et des intégrateurs du monde entier, pour les aider à obtenir des résultats optimaux.",

	"about-team-2": "Nous avons réuni une équipe exceptionnelle de chercheurs et d’experts des technologies nécessaires au bon développement du logiciel. Cette équipe élabore des outils qui simplifient la programmation des robots pour nos clients et développe notamment les cinématiques, l’optimisation mathématique, la simulation, et les algorithmes de CFAO qui sont à l’avant-garde de la technologie robotique, et qui constituent la base de nos solutions.",
